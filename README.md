# Cheating Goose Mod

A simple mod which enables Untitled Goose Game's cheat mode. This mod requires BepInEx.
https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

## Usage:
- Press 'K' to disable/enable NPC's
- Hold '\`' to boost the game's speed.
- '+/-' to increase/decrease the game's speed.

Note that I may have missed some of the in-built cheat functionalities.
